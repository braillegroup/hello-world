# Braille Practice Game
# Embedded Systems Lab Project
# Arduino Project

The idea is to create a braille practice game using LCD and 6 push buttons in 3x2 order both of which are connected to Arduino. The LCD will show the alphabets one by one and a person has to enter the correct Braille pattern using buttons in order to continue the game.
The program can be created by assigning each alphabet/variable a unique button combination/password and then compare it by taking input from buttons.
If the buttons are pressed in correct order, then “true” output will be generated and game continues.
